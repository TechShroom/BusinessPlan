Goals
-----
Some goals of TechShroom Studios are as follows:

* Create one game
* Sell this game
* Buy/design/build the main office

These are goals that should be accomplished in the next 5 years. Other goals are
important, but too far away to list here as a possibility.

Acheiving these goals will be done as follows. First, using the free time
available to the employees, the art, music, code, and other misceallaneous data
will be created for the initial game. Then, the game will be put on
`Steam Greenlight`_ for acceptance into Steam_. Once it is accepted, sales will
start. Hopefully, this is enough for TechShroom to get its own office, rather
than just being "located" wherever the owner currently lives.

One thing that might cause trouble is that Steam Greenlight may be shutting
down. Gabe Newell, CEO of Steam, stated in 2014 that he wanted to shut down
Steam Greenlight in favor of something else (`Source <glshutdown>`_). However,
no more news has come forward and Greenlight is still running today. TechShroom
Studios may still want to consider selling the game itself to avoid Greenlight
fees.

Organization, Directing, and Monitoring
---------------------------------------
In order to meet these goals, high coordination between all members of the
company may be required. Programmers can work on the code for most of the game
without the finalized textures, but delays can be created if the final art,
sound, or other data causes bugs. All tasks will be divided among members who
can take care of them. Goals could be tracked with either an issue tracker or
with some sort of forum, but a weekly progress report is a must for all teams.

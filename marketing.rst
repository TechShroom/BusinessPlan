Marketing
############################
Marketing is going to be handled by word-of-mouth, Steam Greenlight, and
postings to various forums. The prices will be set appropriately for the amount
of time and content that went into the game, as well as the average price for
games of similar genres. Steam sales are also a popular option for promoting
a game, as well as a free weekend. The owner is confident that generating
attention for published games should not be too difficult. The hard part is
making sure that people stay interested in the games they play.

SWOT Analysis and Risks
#######################

SWOT
----

Internal Audit
""""""""""""""

Strengths
    Unique ideas, because they are interesting and something people haven't
    seen.

    Small developer group.

    Personal, the face of the company is the owner and employees, not the brand.

Weaknesses
    Unique ideas, because they may flop.

    Small amount of programmers, development will take longer.

    No prescence in the industry yet.

External Audit
""""""""""""""

Opportunities
    People dislike playing similar games over and over, unqiue ideas fit right
    in

    `Indie games`_ are popular right now (TechShroom is technically an indie
    company)

Threats
    There are a lot of gaming companies to compete with, and gaining visibility
    can be difficult.

    Competitors are also trying to find that golden unqiue idea that sells a lot
    of games.

    Many games seem to be hit-or-miss: either they sell a lot or very few
    copies.

Business Risks
--------------
TechShroom Studios is currently running on employees' free time. This means that
expected delivery times are easily missed if other responsibilities show up.
To address this, once a game is released and making money the company will
switch to requiring time at work every day. This shouldn't occur until the
current employees are out of college, at which point this could be their sole
source of income.

Another risk is having multiple games that are never written or don't sell.
The first risk is easily solveable by creating specific tasks and goals for the
game, but the second risk is harder to fix. It will require a lot of market
research to determine what will make a unique idea also one that sells.
